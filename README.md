# EpPos
EpPos is a basic Django (python)-based Point Of Sale
system that is designed to be platform-independent (it runs on the web) and completely mobile- and
touch-friendly.

## Hold on Epse, what on earth is that POS shenanigans about?
Well, glad you asked. A POS system is a program that is used by salespeople or, more in the scope of
this particular one, waiters at a pub or restaurant. They simple click on what you ordered, it is
added to your addition and tracks the payments. Once you have payed, it adds the money to the
current cash stash and removes that amount of each product from stock (if applicable).

## Well gee, that sounds awesome! How do I run it?
It is very simple. Have a look at the wiki! Or read this block of text since the wiki isn't yet up-to-date.

First off, install Python 3 and Django. If you are using Linux, they are probably in your repo's.
Then [download EpPos](https://github.com/Epse/EpPos/releases) to wherever you want to keep your Django apps, edit settings.py
and change the `DEBUG` var to `False` and add the domain name or IP-address from which the POS will
be accessed to the `ALLOWED_HOSTS` variable. Then run `python manage.py migrate` and `python
manage.py createsuperuser` to create a new admin account which you can use to manage the system and
add new users.
Then set it up like you would set up any normal Django application, we recommend using
[uWSGI](http://uwsgi-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/Django_and_nginx.html) with nginx.

## Known "issues"
- There is a limitation in the total value of an order. It cannot exceed 10 digits, counting decimal places. If someone runs into this: congratulations, I'll have to update this.

## Beauty. Or no! A beast! What now?
You found a bug! Congratulations! You can report this issue on or issue tracker on GitHub. I will be
forever grateful if you could possible be so kind as to include a server log and/or web console log.

## But I can fix that myself!
Absolutely marvellous! Have a look in the CONTRIB.md file for info about contributing!

## I want to make a spinoff!
You absolutely may. If you think what you want in a POS is not something that is in the scope of
EpPOS (although you may always ask) you can for sure just fork it. Details are in the LICENSE file,
we use the Apache license.
